# GitHub Actions Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub Actions section! âš¡

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline directly within your GitHub repository.

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
```

## Core Concepts

### Workflows
Automated processes that run in your repository when triggered by events.

### Jobs
A set of steps that execute on the same runner.

### Steps
Individual tasks that can run commands or actions.

### Actions
Reusable units of code that can be shared across workflows.

## Common Use Cases

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every push
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to production
- **Code Quality**: Linting, security scanning, code coverage
- **Package Management**: Publishing to npm, Docker Hub, etc.
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform deployments, cloud provisioning

## Workflow Examples

### Docker Build & Push
```yaml
name: Docker Build and Push

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      
    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
        
    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: user/app:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
name: Deploy to Kubernetes

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Configure kubectl
      uses: azure/k8s-set-context@v1
      with:
        method: kubeconfig
        kubeconfig: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}
        
    - name: Deploy to cluster
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f k8s/
        kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app
```

## Topics Covered

- **Workflow Syntax**: YAML configuration, triggers, jobs
- **Actions Marketplace**: Using and creating custom actions
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of sensitive data
- **Matrix Builds**: Testing across multiple environments
- **Caching**: Speeding up workflows with dependency caching
- **Environments**: Deployment environments and protection rules
- **Security**: OIDC, permissions, security best practices

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific action versions** (e.g., `@v3` instead of `@main`)
2. **Minimize workflow run time** with caching and parallel jobs
3. **Secure your secrets** and use environment protection rules
4. **Use matrix strategies** for testing across multiple versions
5. **Keep workflows DRY** with reusable workflows and composite actions

> ðŸ”’ **Security Note**: Always use secrets for sensitive data and follow the principle of least privilege for workflow permissions.
